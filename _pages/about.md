I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University,majoring in Information Management and Information Systems, and minoring in Statistics. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in data-driven decision making, with a particular focus on developing statistical methods for problems arising in these areas.

Currently, I am looking for opportunities to pursue a PhD degree in Statistics or Operations Research.
